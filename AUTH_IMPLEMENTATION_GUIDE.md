# AI StudyAssist - Authentication Implementation Guide

## ðŸš€ Complete Setup Instructions

### Phase 1: Supabase Setup (Do this first!)

#### Step 1: Enable Email Authentication
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ Authentication â†’ Providers
2. Enable "Email" provider

- `middleware.ts` - Route protection
- `components/AuthButton.tsx` - Logout button component

**Modified Files:**
- `lib/supabase.ts` - Updated with auth methods
- `app/layout.tsx` - Wrapped with auth provider
- `app/page.tsx` - Protected dashboard with user data
- All API routes - Filter by user_id
