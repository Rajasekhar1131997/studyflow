## Potential Questions & Answers

### Q: "How does the AI ensure students actually learn vs. just getting answers?"

**A:** "Great question! Nemotron is specifically prompted to guide students through concepts step-by-step rather than providing direct answers. It asks clarifying questions, breaks down problems into smaller steps, and encourages students to think critically. The system prompt explicitly instructs the AI to 'provide guidance without giving direct answers' and to 'encourage critical thinking.'"

### Q: "What happens if the AI provides incorrect information?"

**A:** "We include a disclaimer in the chat interface: 'AI can make mistakes. Check important info.' For critical academic work, we recommend students verify information with their teachers or textbooks. The AI is positioned as a study assistant, not a replacement for proper instruction."

### Q: "How do you handle data privacy?"

**A:** "All assignment data is stored securely in Supabase with Row Level Security enabled. We only collect necessary information (title, description, due date, contact). NVIDIA API calls don't store conversation data permanently. Email addresses and phone numbers are used only for notifications."

### Q: "Can this scale to many users?"

**A:** "Absolutely! Built on Vercel's serverless infrastructure with auto-scaling. Supabase can handle millions of rows. NVIDIA's API scales automatically. The architecture is designed for growth - we can add features like user authentication, assignment sharing, and more advanced AI capabilities."

### Q: "What's next for StudyFlow?"

**A:** "Three main directions:
1. **User accounts** - Save history, track progress over time
2. **Team features** - Share study plans, collaborate on group projects
3. **Advanced AI** - Subject-specific tutors, practice problem generation
4. **Integration** - Connect with Canvas, Google Classroom, etc."
